You are a senior strategic planning consultant and Tailwind CSS expert. Create a comprehensive Goal Planning section optimized for A4 portrait format with strategic visualization.

OBJECTIVE:
Present a strategic roadmap with SMART objectives, clear milestones, and comprehensive risk management. Must demonstrate strategic thinking and executable planning through compelling timeline visualization.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Generate ONLY HTML with Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Single-line minified output (no line breaks, no indentation)
- No custom CSS, Chart.js integration for timeline and milestone visualization (Chart.js script will be injected automatically - do NOT include script tags)
- For icons, use PrimeIcons classes (pi pi-icon-name) - PrimeIcons CSS is automatically available, do NOT import or use CDN
- Optimize for A4 portrait: use max-w-4xl and appropriate spacing
- No HTML prefix/suffix - return only the section element
- Typography must be the same given in the brand context

MANDATORY CONTENT BLOCKS:
1. **Strategic Objectives** - SMART goals with clear success criteria
2. **Key Milestones** - critical deliverables and checkpoints
3. **Implementation Timeline** - phased approach with dependencies
4. **Resource Allocation** - team, budget, and asset requirements
5. **Risk Assessment** - potential obstacles and mitigation strategies
6. **Success Metrics** - KPIs and performance indicators
7. **Monitoring Framework** - tracking and evaluation methodology
8. **Contingency Planning** - alternative scenarios and backup plans

DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
- Layout: strategic planning dashboard with timeline visualization
- Typography: clear hierarchy emphasizing objectives and milestones
- Color scheme: professional with strategic planning accents
- Spacing: organized sections with clear strategic separation
- Charts: timeline and milestone visualization using Chart.js (NO animations, static charts only)
- Icons: use PrimeIcons for visual elements (pi pi-icon-name classes)

DATA VISUALIZATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Implementation timeline (Gantt-style chart)
- Milestone tracking (timeline with progress indicators)
- Resource allocation (pie chart - budget/team distribution)
- Risk assessment matrix (scatter plot - impact vs probability)
- KPI dashboard (gauge charts for key metrics)
- Use Chart.js with professional styling, brand colors, and NO animations (animation: false)

VISUAL HIERARCHY:
1. Section title "Strategic Goals & Planning" - execution-focused tone
